      <h2>Ocean's 8</h2>
      <p>Nice comedy-crime tape about the sophisticated theft of a diamond necklace. Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock), Danny Ocean's sister, is released on parole from prison.  For five years she was not taught anything, and she immediately begins to prepare for a major robbery.  The target is a $ 150 million diamond necklace that will appear at the MET Gala at the famed Metropolitan Museum of Art.  After meeting with Lou Miller (Cate Blanchett), her longtime friend, Debbie begins to gather the best specialists in their field and prepare a daring plan. Already the beginning of the film shows that what we have before us is nothing more than a soft restart of the original film "Ocean's Eleven"</p>
